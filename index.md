### The Bug and Changes in Code after Debugging:

#### Bug Description:

The original reverseInPlace method attempts to reverse the array by directly assigning elements from the end 
to the start, leading to data loss and incorrect reversal, especially evident in arrays with an odd number 
of elements.

### Before Code Change:

```java
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
        arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
}
```
After Code Change
To fix the bug, the reverseInPlace method is corrected to use a temporary variable to swap elements from the 
start and end of the array, ensuring accurate reversal without data loss.

```java
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i += 1) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
        arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
    }
}
```

This adjustment correctly debuggs the code by ensuring that the array is correctly reversed in place, making 
the method function as expected for arrays of any length.
